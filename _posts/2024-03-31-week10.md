title: Week 10

This week two members of our team solved two issues for p5 but haven't been assigned for them. Leo and I are still try to familiar with p5. We tried to solve an issue and after discussions between us and another contributor, it should not be a coding issue. This clarification somewhat helps the questioner. Through this question, I am curious whether Chinese fonts are supported in p5 web editor. I found that Chinese based on this

specific font cannot be encoded. I originally thought this could be a problem, but p5 and p5 web editor are two projects. In p5 running on a self computer, users can configure appropriate fonts themselves, so not supporting Chinese should not be a problem. I think the part where we can make an obvious contribution should be the proposal, which has relatively low technical requirements. Most of p5's problems are based on webGL, and none of us are experts in this area.

For my individual contribution part, I focused on correcting the names of three Beijing schools that I am familiar with this week. Since I noticed this in openStreetMap, I thought wikiPedia would have the same opportunity for me to contribute. I noticed that both schools' names had parts that could be tweaked, so I contributed. Next week I plan to contribute to a github project so I can interact with the maintainer. Editing OSM and Wikipedia is difficult to get interactive so I'd like to find another contribution to make.
