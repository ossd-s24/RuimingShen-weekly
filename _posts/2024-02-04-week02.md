I believe the Code of Conduct represents a consensus, providing everyone with a sense of safety because projects that utilize a Code of Conduct allow contributors to operate within an environment and set of rules they are familiar with. Not using a Code of Conduct can amplify their concerns. These concerns often cover many aspects,

such as whether their contributions will be accepted (due to unknown standards of acceptance), and whether their contributions meet the requirements, among other issues. Personally, I donâ€™t necessarily think that projects without a Code of Conduct should not receive contributions. It depends. If I can see a record of past accepted contributions and I plan to make a similar contribution, then I would work on this. But if not, I would choose to stay away from the project.

Regarding the Code of Conduct, since each project has different specifics, it's difficult to standardize the Code of Conduct. And rules like respecting others cannot be enforced through code, at least not currently,  things like insulting images and language can only be identified by human for now. Perhaps in the future, with more advanced technology, enforcing the Code of Conduct through AI might become possible.
