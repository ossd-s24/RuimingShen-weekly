This week we made a PowerPoint for p5 presentation. We planned to have rehearsal before presentation. I'm happy that my contribution was finally merged this week. In terms of personal contributions, I tried to create an article about a Korean player I like in League of Legends, but it didn't pass wikipedia's review. Also, I recommended specitify in Hellogithub.

My individual contribution part has come to an end. I think my contribution to the Wikipedia part was not very sufficient, but I did not find other parts that allowed me to contribute. I just corrected the names of my middle school and high school. Since I am a Chinese, the contribution I can make to Wikipedia's English community is very limited. But I live in Jersey City and I found that the operating status of Grove Street has not been updated, so I updated it. I hope our presentation next week will go well.

Spring has arrived, and I still remember that on my way to my linear algebra class in my sophomore year, I passed by Washington Square Park and saw the happy faces of the graduates wearing purple robes. Time flies so fast, and now I have to graduate wearing a purple robe. New York is so beautiful in the spring, but I have to leave at this season. I feel very sad.
