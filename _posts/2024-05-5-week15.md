Our group completed the presentation this week and it went very well. The two sets of presentations that impressed me the most were Godot and Gitlab. Gitlab is a very good project, and I might want to start contributing to it because it is a very famous project and is also very beginner-friendly. Godot is a game engine. I was surprised that the group that presented it even met the founder of Godot and had a conversation.

For myself, all the tasks have been completed, I only need to write the final reflecition, and then the course is over. This course gave me a deep understanding of open source, both in terms of business and community. By understanding how open source projects work, I can build my own projects in the future and use the various git commands learned in this class in working company.
