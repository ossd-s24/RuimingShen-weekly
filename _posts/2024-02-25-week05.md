What impressed me most about this weekâ€™s class was the food computer. I personally also chose this video to watch before class started. Before this video I never thought that everyone could be a farmer. Agriculture is an ancient thing to me, and computers seem to have no possible connection with agriculture. But through this video, I learned that there are many young programmers in the United States who are using computers to promote the development of agriculture, cultivate their own crops, share the data they have obtained with others, and find optimal cultivation solutions. I think what I can do is to participate in these open source food computer projects and cultivate the crops I am interested in. First, I will learn from other people's cultivation plans, and then innovate myself. If the innovation achieves good results, then PR my solution to the open source community.
For small contributions, I started preparations and thought I could contribute to the Beijing map in OpenStreetMap. I saw many people's comments on the map, representing their questions. For example, "Is it possible to ride a bike in Beihai Park?" (Obviously no, you can't ride a bike in parks that are in the center of a city because of the high density of people!) I plan to answer these questions and highlight some places worth paying attention to.
